This is a game I've been working on intermittently for the past several years.
The original version was in perl, but when I expanded the mechanics to include
things like elements and terrain, I reworked it in python (my first foray into
that language.)  When I last set the project aside, the next task on my list was to
un-nest the class structure, because I discovered you can only serialize the
top level of a class in python, because [good reasons.]

If you've got any interest in this game, please contact github@prykop.com
